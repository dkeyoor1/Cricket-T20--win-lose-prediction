# Predicting Cricket T20 Match Outcomes Using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict the outcome of cricket T20 matches. It utilizes logistic regression to analyze real-time match data and determine the probability of each team winning or losing.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess historical cricket match data to extract relevant features and prepare it for model training.

2. **Model Building:** Train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.

3. **Real-time Data Scraping:** Scrape real-time match data from cricbuzz.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation:** Preprocess the scraped data, feed it into the trained model, and evaluate the prediction accuracy.
